		<h1>Who am I?</h1>
			<p>
			I'm Julia Traiba, 26 years old. Currently I'm a Bachelor student in the Faculty of Informatics at the University of Lugano. 
			I'm also a wife and a mother of 3  children.
			I like walking or looking at the scenery. I spend much of my free time with my little children, but when they are not with me 
			I like to read a good book. Most of all I Iike to understand why, it has been my favourite question since I was 4 years old.<br>
			</p>

<!-- .....................................................Faculty of Informatics................................................. -->	

			<h2> Faculty of Informatics</h2>
				<p>
				I like Informatics and the world of computer science, and I have always wanted to become a scientist, since I was only a child. 
				<br>
				I didn't study for many years. My last year of study was in 2008, but now I have chosen to study informatics, 
				because I like it and I wish to follow my passion for this subject. 
				<br>
				Why USI? Because of my family it was difficult to get away from Lugano, but I have the chance to live close to one 
				of the best Cantonal Universities in Switzerland with an international campus and a Bachelors in English. What more could I ask for?
				</p>
				<br>

			<h2>Where am I from?</h2>
				<p>
				I'm literally a citizen of the world, not politically, but due to my origin. 
				I have a multinational/ethnical family.
				My father grew up in Colombia, but he's also German, and my mother is Swiss, 
				and due to my father's job, we moved a lot.<br>
				In my childhood, I moved about every 2 years. A lot of change, 
				but a unique experience. But for many years after that it was difficult to find stability.
				</p> 
				
<!-- .....................................................Childhood................................................. -->						
				
				<h3>Childhood</h3>
					<p>
					At the beginning of my life I lived in the Swiss-French part, and France, but when I was 8 years old, 
					we moved to the Italian part, and because of this I am totally bilingual.
					Depending on the subject, I think in French or in Italian. In a lot of situations this characteristic 
					can be funny.
					</p>

				<h3>Study</h3>
					<p> 
					Due to my multiple changes, my Education was very complicated. I changed places, types of school and 
					professors many times. This is impossible to put in a normal CV. But If you have interest <a href="CV.pdf">come here</a>.

<!-- ...................................What happened after?/ A family................................................. -->			
		
			<h2>What happened after?</h2>

				<h3>A family</h3>
					<p> 
					One day 10 years ago I decided to escape far away from this nomadic life. I left for Toscana, in Italy,
					where I got married, and I continued my high school education. But for many reasons, we had to return to Switzerland. <br> 
					At that time in my life I decided to stop everything, and to start a family. I was 21 years old when I had my first daughter,
					and since then I have two other daughters.
					</p>

				<h3>Why change something?</h3>
					<p>
					Life always has good and bad sides. In August 2013, I had my last child. I am very proud of my children, 
					but something in my life was wrong, and taking care of three children is also difficult today.<br>
					For many years, I chose to ignore my brain, and to switch off my thoughts, but it was impossible. <br>
